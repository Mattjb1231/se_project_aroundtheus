# Project 3: Around The U.S. by Matthew Barriera

### Overview  

**Information
*This is my project 3 and how I had to make a responsive web page of someone traveling around the us and the different sites they visited and making it seem like a Instagram account with buttons such as a like button and a edit button. Also had to adjust the sizes of the different ways of viewing the website from phones, tablets, and desktop versions and how smooth and responsive the website is to make sure it can stay correct no matter the format.
